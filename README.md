## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [react-gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) - for deployment onGitHub Pages

### Notes

- This originally was completed with prop-drilling but thanks to @andrewg010 (see [#Acknowledgments](acknowlodgements)), it was converted to use context
- I was not able to implement the light/dark theme toggle - I think I'd need to utilise npm packages to complete this.
- Likewise for the drag-and-drop feature.

### Useful resources

- [Using localStorage with React Hooks - LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-localstorage-react-hooks/) - Ibadehin Mojeed's thorough explanation how to utilise localStorage with React Hooks was extremely helpful - along with their `useLocalStorage` custom hook which was used in this project.
